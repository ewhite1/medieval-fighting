# medieval-fighting
a simple two player fighting game in swift

Here are the requirements:
- App should be landscape only(done)
- App should have two characters. Each character has:
- HP(done)
- Attack Power(done)
- Name(done)
This is a two player game so each character should have an attack button(done). When one player attacks, 
the other player/button is disabled for 3 seconds before they can attack
If a player dies, the screen should print who won
When the game ends, give an option to restart the game
Use Classes to build your game


Optional(to spice it up) Stuff:

- Add sound fx for the attacks and death
- Add some background music
- When the game first starts allow each player to choose which character they want to be, the orc or the solider 
(ie you could have two soliders fighting each other or two orcs, etc)
- Create a Game class that manages the game state (instead of using the view controller)
